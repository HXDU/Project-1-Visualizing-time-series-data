## Introduction
  This project provides an interactive visualization of time series data: 2018 California wildfire tweets (Nov 08 â€“ Nov 30) in 3 different aspects: a. The total number of tweets collected & 2018 California wildfire tweets over time; b. The top 10 topics generated by a LDA topic modeling model, each representing by 5 words; c. The number of 2018 California wildfire tweets in the following categories: locations (in or out of California), rescue related or not.    
  
## Data
2018 California wildfire tweets (from Nov 08 to Nov 30), searched from tweets collected during which time.   
Attributes collected: tweets ID, time, user name, tweets and locations. 

## Processing (Python):
1. Search:
    Delete items with empty attribute(s).  
    Dynamically expand key words lists for searching by checking the qualified tweets and unqualified ones.
2. Cleaning for topic modeling
    Remove non-ascii characters, urls, user name in retweets, hashtags, punctuation and stopwords.
    Get tokenized, lemmatized, build a dictionary for LDA topic modeling.
3. Train the model and get the top 10 topics generated by the model.
